In my exploration of reinforcement learning, I conducted a comprehensive investigation into policy gradient algorithms, specifically focusing on REINFORCE and Actor-Critic methods.  Leveraging linear function approximation, I implemented and rigorously evaluated these algorithms on two benchmark environments: MountainCar-v0 and CartPole-v1.  These environments presented unique challenges: MountainCar-v0 with its continuous state space and CartPole-v1 with its discrete but multi-dimensional state space.

To address the continuous nature of MountainCar-v0's state space, I designed and implemented a tile coding algorithm.  This technique effectively discretized the state space, allowing the policy gradient algorithms to operate efficiently.  For CartPole-v1, the challenge lay in capturing the complex relationships between its multiple state dimensions.  Here, I explored alternative tile coding approaches to create a suitable representation for the policy gradient algorithms to learn from.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different policy gradient algorithms and the impact of function approximation techniques on their performance.  Furthermore, by tackling environments with varying state space complexities, I developed a deeper understanding of how to tailor reinforcement learning approaches to specific problem domains.  These findings not only contribute to my personal growth in the field of AI but also lay the groundwork for further exploration of more advanced reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications in more intricate real-world scenarios.
